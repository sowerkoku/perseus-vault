PerseusVaultEventStore — a persistent FastMCP ``EventStore`` backed by SQLite.

This is **MCP infrastructure**, not a "Perseus Vault Python library". It gives any
FastMCP / Streamable-HTTP server SSE *stream resumability* across restarts by
durably persisting the JSON-RPC events that flow over a session's SSE streams.
When a client reconnects with a ``Last-Event-ID``, the transport asks this store
to replay everything that came after it.

It implements the real ``mcp.server.streamable_http.EventStore`` ABC:

    * ``store_event(stream_id, message) -> event_id``
    * ``replay_events_after(last_event_id, send_callback) -> stream_id | None``

plus a ``cleanup_before(...)`` retention helper (not part of the ABC).

Usage::

    from perseus_vault_persist import PerseusVaultEventStore
    from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP

    mcp = FastMCP("my-server", event_store=PerseusVaultEventStore())

Storage model
-------------
Events live in a **dedicated** ``events`` table in their **own** SQLite file
(default ``~/.perseus-vault/data/mcp_events.db``). This is deliberately separate from
Perseus Vault's Rust ``entities`` table — the two never share a table or a file.

    CREATE TABLE events (
        event_id   TEXT PRIMARY KEY,   -- opaque UUID handed back to the client
        stream_id  TEXT NOT NULL,      -- the SSE stream the event belongs to
        seq        INTEGER NOT NULL,   -- global monotonic order (replay cursor)
        payload    TEXT,               -- JSON of the JSONRPCMessage, or NULL (priming)
        created_at REAL NOT NULL       -- unix seconds, used by retention cleanup
    );
    CREATE INDEX idx_events_stream_seq ON events(stream_id, seq);

.. warning::

   **Payloads are stored as PLAINTEXT.** This store does **NOT** share Perseus Vault's
   AES-256-GCM encryption. That encryption is implemented in Perseus Vault's Rust core
   and only ever applies at the *column* level to ``entities.body_json`` — it
   does not extend to this separate events database. If your JSON-RPC traffic
   carries sensitive data, encrypt the database file at the OS/volume level, or
   wrap this store (Python-side encryption of ``payload`` is an optional
   stretch, intentionally out of scope here).

Concurrency
-----------
The store opens one SQLite connection in WAL mode (one writer, many readers) and
serialises writes behind an ``asyncio.Lock`` so the monotonic ``seq`` counter is
assigned without races inside a single server process.
