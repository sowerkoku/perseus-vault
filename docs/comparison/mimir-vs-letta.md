## Architecture: Composable vs Monolithic

Perseus Vault is a **pure memory engine** — it does one thing (persistent memory) and
composes with any agent framework via MCP stdio. Letta is an **agent runtime**
that includes memory as one component.

### Perseus Vault: Memory as a Service

```
CrewAI ──────────┐
LangGraph ───────┤
AutoGen ─────────┼──MCP stdio── mimir (Rust binary)
Claude Desktop ──┤                    └── SQLite
Cursor ──────────┘
```

Perseus Vault plugs into any MCP host. Your agents can use CrewAI, LangGraph, AutoGen,
or any framework — Perseus Vault is just the memory layer.

### Letta: Everything in One Box

```
Letta Agent ── Letta Runtime ── PostgreSQL
                    ├── Memory blocks
                    ├── Tool execution
                    ├── Message history
                    └── Agent state
```

Letta agents run inside Letta's runtime. The memory is coupled to the agent
framework. You can't use Letta's memory with a CrewAI agent or a Claude Desktop
session.

## When to Use Perseus Vault

- You want memory that **works with any agent framework**
- You're building agents with CrewAI, LangGraph, AutoGen, or raw MCP
- You want a **single binary** with no database to manage
- You need **encryption at rest**
- You want **36 MCP tools** for the full memory lifecycle
- You need fully offline/air-gapped operation

## When to Use Letta

- You want a **complete agent platform** with built-in memory
- You're building Letta-native agents and want tight integration
- You need **advanced agent features** beyond memory (multi-agent orchestration, sandboxed execution)
- Your team is comfortable with Docker + PostgreSQL
- You want Letta's advanced memory management (archival memory, recall memory, core memory blocks)

## Memory Models

### Perseus Vault: Lifecycle-Aware Entities

Perseus Vault entities have a full lifecycle:
- **Ebbinghaus decay** — memories naturally fade unless retrieved
- **Layer promotion** — buffer → working → core based on access patterns
- **Automatic archival** — stale entities archive, recoverable
- **Conflict detection** — trigram similarity finds near-duplicates
- **Entity graph** — link entities with typed relationships
- **Journal** — append-only audit trail

### Letta: Memory Blocks

Letta organizes memory into blocks:
- **Core memory** (always loaded)
- **Recall memory** (conversation history)
- **Archival memory** (long-term storage)

This is effective for Letta's agent architecture but is **tied to Letta's
agent loop**. The memory blocks are managed by the Letta runtime, not by
a standalone memory service.

## MCP Tools: 36 vs 8

Perseus Vault's 36 MCP tools cover the entire memory surface. Letta exposes ~8 tools
focused on agent state management. Perseus Vault's additional tools enable:

- **mimir_correct** — structured learning from errors
- **mimir_synthesize** — LLM session synthesis
- **mimir_bench** — performance tracking
- **mimir_federate** — cross-workspace entity sharing
- **mimir_vault_export/import** — portable markdown format
- **mimir_purge** — permanent deletion with VACUUM reclaim

## Honest Assessment

**Perseus Vault's strengths vs Letta:**
- Composable with any framework (not locked into one agent runtime)
- Single binary, no PostgreSQL dependency
- 36 MCP tools vs 8
- Encryption at rest
- Full entity lifecycle management
- MIT license

**Perseus Vault's weaknesses vs Letta:**
- Letta has a more mature agent platform with advanced features
- Letta's memory block model is well-tested in production
- Letta provides managed cloud hosting (Letta Cloud)
- Larger community and more documentation
- Sandboxed code execution is Letta-native

**If you're choosing today:** Perseus Vault is the better choice if you want memory
that works with any agent framework. Letta is better if you want a complete
managed agent platform and are willing to commit to Letta's ecosystem.
