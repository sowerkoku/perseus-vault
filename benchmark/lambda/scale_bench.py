"""scale_bench.py — WS2: statistically meaningful recall + latency at scale.

Generates a LABELED corpus of topical clusters, embeds it on GPU, then measures
dense vs FTS5 vs hybrid recall@k and latency percentiles at volume. Unlike the
8-entity smoke (rag_bench.py), this produces numbers that actually mean something.

Ground truth: each of C clusters has a canonical concept + M paraphrased entities
(distinct keys, shared cluster_id in a tag). A query paraphrases the concept; a
hit is "relevant" iff the retrieved entity belongs to the query's cluster.
recall@k = (relevant retrieved in top-k) / min(k, cluster_size).

Reuses the MCP JSON-RPC driver from rag_bench.py (same directory).
