# PERF.md — measured optimizations (before/after)

Every entry: fixed hardware, named binary/commit, the profile that led to the
change, and the numbers. Companion to `benchmark/scale/` (signed baselines +
CI budgets) and the #473 epic's rule: no claim without a rerunnable script.
GPU co-residency numbers (recall under 100% MI300X load) live in
[`docs/deployment-amd-mi300x.md`](docs/deployment-amd-mi300x.md).

## #530 — GPU contention + agent economics: recall unaffected at 100% accelerator load

Not an optimization — a measured property of the architecture, recorded here
with the same rules (named hardware, rerunnable script). Perseus Vault's
memory layer is host-CPU-resident and uses 0 bytes of GPU HBM; the claim
"recall steals no inference cycles from a co-located model" was measured on
rented hardware on 2026-07-09. Harness: `benchmark/contention/`
(`live_bench.py` for the real-serving rows, `burn_bench.py` for the synthetic
row). Every row is tagged `measured` (timed live) or `projection` (derived
from published specs) — there are no projections below.

**Hardware A:** AMD Instinct MI300X 192 GB (RunPod, $2.19/GPU-hr retail),
vLLM 0.19.1 + ROCm 7.13, host AMD EPYC 9474F, serving Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct
bf16. **Hardware B (cross-vendor baseline):** 2× NVIDIA H100 SXM 80 GB
(Lambda, $8.38/hr, NVLink), same model, same vLLM version, same bench
parameters.

### Recall under accelerator load (100K-entity store, host CPU)

| Condition | Recall p50 | Δ vs idle | data_source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GPU idle | 18.7 ms | — | measured |
| GPU serving 72B under sustained load | 18.8 ms | **±0.6% median (6 idle-vs-serving runs, range −0.4% to +1.1%)** | measured |
| GPU 100% util, synthetic FP16 matmul (97.4 TFLOPS sustained) | — | **+0.6%** | measured |

Recall on the host CPU is flat whether the accelerator is idle, serving a 72B
model flat-out, or pinned by a synthetic compute burn: the memory layer and
the accelerator do not contend. This section doubles as a regression guard —
if the recall path ever grows GPU or lock contention, these deltas move.

### Agent economics (measured throughput × measured rental price)

| Metric | 1× MI300X | 2× H100 SXM (best boot) | data_source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Holds Qwen2.5-72B bf16 | one card | 1 card cannot load it; 2 required | measured |
| Concurrent 8K-token agents/card(s) | **15.3** (vLLM KV-cache ceiling) | 5.0 (eager-only, 97% util — the only config that boots) | measured |
| GPU $/agent-hour | **$0.143** ($2.19 ÷ 15.3) | $1.68 ($8.38 ÷ 5.0) | measured |
| Sustained output tok/s | 658 | — | measured |
| $/1M output tokens | **$0.92** (untuned bf16) | — | measured |

Measured-vs-measured, the MI300X's $/agent-hour advantage is **11.7×**. Scope,
stated plainly: untuned out-of-the-box vLLM, bf16 weights, no FP8, no
speculative decoding — treat the MI300X numbers as a floor. Deliberately NOT
recorded here: single-process serving-throughput floors from earlier runs
(wrong serving shape). Reproduce: serve any OpenAI-compatible endpoint, then
`python benchmark/contention/live_bench.py --gpu-price <$/hr> --vllm-log
<log>`; synthetic row via `python benchmark/contention/burn_bench.py`.

## #511 — hybrid recall: the "fusion-machinery overhead" was the sparse arm's join-per-match hydration

**Hardware:** same box as #476/#507 (AMD64 16-core, Windows 11). A/B on an
IDENTICAL loaded 100K store (seeded once by `benchmark/scale/run.py
--keep-db` on post-#543 main, kept), 100 queries/mode over MCP stdio with the
scale harness's exact query shape and limit, before = main + the timing
instrumentation only, after = this change. Every number below is `measured`.

### Where the time went (stage attribution, new `MIMIR_RECALL_TIMING=1`)

Windows has no cheap flamegraph story for a release binary driven over MCP
stdio, so this change adds the permanent alternative: opt-in per-stage timing
on the recall path (`MIMIR_RECALL_TIMING=1`, one line per query to stderr,
zero cost when off). 30 timed hybrid queries at 100K, p50 per stage:

| Stage | Before | After | data_source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| embed (query vector) | 6.1 ms | 6.2 ms | measured |
| dense arm | 23.1 ms | 25.4 ms (concurrent) | measured |
| **sparse arm (BM25)** | **247.4 ms** | **60.3 ms (concurrent)** | measured |
| graph expand | 0.02 ms | 0.02 ms | measured |
| RRF fuse | 0.10 ms | 0.09 ms | measured |
| usefulness boost | 0.45 ms | 0.33 ms | measured |
| metadata filter + truncate | 0.01 ms | 0.01 ms | measured |
| **total** | **277.0 ms** | **67.2 ms** | measured |

The issue's suspects, settled by the profile: RRF candidate over-fetch +
hydration, query expansion, graph expand's link following, and the post-RRF
weighting passes are **all ≤ 0.5 ms combined**. 88% of hybrid's cost was the
sparse arm: its single SQL joined EVERY FTS match to `entities` and evaluated
the full 24-column row — multi-KB `body_json` overflow chains included —
before `ORDER BY rank LIMIT k` could discard it. A broad term matches most of
the corpus, so that was ~100K record reads per hybrid recall: the #476/#507
disease, third instance, hiding in the FTS5→entities join.

### The fix (two changes, exactness-preserving)

1. **Two-phase BM25 (`fts5_bm25_search`):** phase 1 ranks `rowid + bm25()`
   entirely inside the FTS index — the `entities` table is never touched;
   phase 2 hydrates and metadata-filters only a bounded pool (3× the arm's
   limit, floor 128) in rank order. If filters eat the whole pool it widens
   once (4096), then falls back to the exact single-query plan — the answer
   is never silently truncated, and both plans share one predicate builder so
   they cannot drift. Result sets are identical (see recall gates below).
2. **Concurrent arms:** the dense and sparse arms are independent read-only
   queries on separate pooled connections (`Database` is already shared as
   `Arc<Database>` across server threads, #210) — hybrid now pays
   max(dense, sparse) instead of dense + sparse.

### Numbers (100K entities, identical store, 100 queries/mode)

| Mode | Before p50/p99 | After p50/p99 | Δ p50 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| hybrid | 295.5 / 337.0 ms | **80.9 / 93.8 ms** | **3.7×** |
| dense | 25.5 / 31.0 ms | 25.1 / 30.9 ms | unchanged |
| fts5 | 16.5 / 19.9 ms | 17.0 / 20.7 ms | unchanged (noise) |

Hybrid vs the sum of its arms: 7.0× before (295.5 vs ~42 ms) → **1.9×
after** (80.9 vs ~42 ms) — inside the issue's ≤2× acceptance target. The
scale-gate hybrid p99 budget tightens 1000 → 250 ms so the before-state
(p99 ≥ 282 ms on this box) can never silently return.

### Recall-quality gates (before AND after, same stores/seeds)

* `benchmark/recall/` (deterministic, bundled ONNX): **byte-identical** —
  same report signature (`d78c7240…`), hybrid recall@5 95.8 both sides.
  recall@5 regression: **0 pt**.
* `benchmark/longmemeval/` retrieval-only (no LLM, no API key), first 100
  instances, paired: recall@5 93.0 → 93.0, recall@10 99.0 → 99.0. recall@1/@3
  wobble ±3 pt run-to-run in this regime, but the baseline binary differs
  from ITSELF on 53/100 per-question top-10s across reruns (async
  auto-embed-on-write race in the harness's ingest-then-immediately-query
  loop) — the wobble is harness self-noise, not a ranking change; the
  deterministic harness above is the ranking gate.

### Residual (next target)

The remaining hybrid-over-dense cost IS the sparse arm now: BM25 must score
every FTS match to rank them (~60 ms for ~100K matched rows), an engine-level
O(matches) floor for broad terms, concurrent with (and larger than) the dense
arm. Shrinking it means capping or pre-pruning the match set — a recall
trade, not free machinery — so it stays out of scope here.

## #507 — dense recall: covering index for the phase-0 signature scan (v18)

**Hardware:** same box as #476. A/B on the IDENTICAL loaded 100K store (kept
from the scale harness), 50 queries/mode, before = the #476-merged binary,
after = this change; the after binary's first open runs the v18 migration.

### Where the time went

`dense_search` phase 0 — the "cheap" sign-bit prefilter — and the embedded-row
count both predicate on `embedding IS NOT NULL`. `embedding`/`emb_sig` are
late ALTER columns stored AFTER `body_json` in each record, so evaluating the
predicate (and reading `emb_sig`) walked every row's multi-KB body overflow
chain: ~900MB of page reads per dense query at 100K. `embedding_coverage()`,
consulted per recall to pick the default mode, paid the same walk.

### The fix (v18)

`idx_entities_dense_sig ON entities(archived, id, emb_sig) WHERE emb_sig IS
NOT NULL` — every column the phase-0 queries touch is an index column, so
they plan as USING COVERING INDEX (~60B/row; zero record reads), pinned by a
plan-text regression test. The queries re-key on `emb_sig IS NOT NULL`, made
exact by the v18 invariant "embedded ⟺ signed": the migration backfills
`emb_sig` from every stored embedding (pure sign-bit recompute, no model),
and writers already set/clear both columns together. Two variants that do
NOT work, for the record: the `embedding IS NOT NULL` spelling never covers
(residual predicate seeks the table), and an expression index only covers on
SQLite ≥ 3.5x — newer than the bundled engine.

### Numbers (100K entities, identical store)

| Mode | Before p50/p99 | After p50/p99 | Δ p50 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| dense | 360.3 / 390.9 ms | **24.9 / 29.3 ms** | **14.5×** |
| hybrid | 593.9 / 620.7 ms | 308.4 / 325.3 ms | 1.9× |
| fts5 | 14.6 / 17.9 ms | 17.0 / 19.4 ms | unchanged (noise) |

### Residual (next target)

Hybrid ≫ dense + fts5 (308 vs ~42 ms): roughly 265ms lives in the hybrid-only
machinery (RRF fusion candidate over-fetch and hydration, query expansion,
graph expand's per-candidate link following) — filed as its own issue with
this A/B as the baseline.

## #476 — write path: signature-driven near-duplicate scan (v17)

**Hardware:** AMD64 16-core (AMD Family 26), Windows 11 · `benchmark/scale/run.py`,
MCP stdio, one persistent process, seeded corpus, ~40–120-word bodies (~9KB stored).

### Where the time went

The per-write near-duplicate scan walked **every same-category entity row**:
each candidate's multi-KB `body_json` was hydrated (overflow pages included)
and re-hashed with `body_hash64` as the signature freshness guard — even
though the #392 signature machinery could already decide verdicts without the
body. Cost per write: O(N·body_size) — ~90MB read+hashed per insert at 10K
rows, ~900MB at 100K. Attribution was confirmed empirically before the fix:
removing the embedding stack entirely (lite build) still showed the 15×
first-to-last-10% degradation, and the opt-in FTS prefilter (#228) measured
*slower* than the scan it pruned (a 64-term OR MATCH per write).

### The fix (v17, exactness-preserving)

1. `dedup_signatures` gains scope columns + a `(category, workspace_hash,
   tg_count)` index; a one-time migration backfills every active row's
   signature ("every active row has a signature" becomes an invariant).
2. The scan walks **signatures only** — small fixed-size rows, SQL-band-pruned
   by the lossless trigram-count ratio bound (`J ≥ t ⟹ min(a,b)/max(a,b) ≥ t`),
   then the existing lossless count/histogram prunes + exact merge verdict.
3. Freshness moves to **verify-on-hit**: only a candidate whose signature says
   "dup" gets its body fetched and re-checked (hash + scope + archived), with
   self-healing repair. Never a false positive; the deliberate trade is that a
   row rewritten behind the engine's back can be missed (one extra stored row)
   until it self-heals — the old guard taxed every write for everyone to cover
   that rare case. The lossy FTS prefilter is retired outright.

### Numbers

| Metric | Before (2.19.0) | After (this change) | Δ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 10K load, sustained | 141/s | **554/s** | **3.9×** |
| 10K load, first→last 10% | 1107 → 68/s (16×) | 1197 → 349/s (3.4×) | 5.1× at the tail |
| 100K load, sustained | 7/s (~4.0h wall) | **39/s (43min wall)** | **5.6×** |
| 100K load, first→last 10% | 117 → 3/s | 483 → 18/s | 6× at the tail |
| 100K fts5 recall p50/p99 | 16.5 / 181.7 ms | 16.1 / **21.7** ms | p99 spikes gone¹ |
| 100K `as_of` p99 | 0.32 ms | 0.26 ms | unchanged path |
| 100K cold start | 70.2 ms | 71.7 ms | unchanged path |

¹ The baseline's fts5 p99 outliers were dedup I/O pressure from the write
phase's page-cache churn; with bodies out of the scan they disappear.

Measurement note: the AFTER runs shared the machine with an API-paced
LongMemEval harness (bursty local ingest); the BEFORE baselines ran clean.
The improvement figures are therefore lower bounds.

Verdict-correctness is pinned by the randomized differential property test
(`find_near_duplicate_signature_path_matches_exhaustive_scan_property`)
against the verbatim pre-#392 exhaustive reference, plus contract tests for
the verify-on-hit guard (no false positives, self-heal) and raw-row
visibility. Full suite: 383 passed.

### Residual (next targets)

The remaining 10K tail decay (1197 → 349/s) is embed-on-write CPU (the lite
build measured a flat ~35% embed tax) and FTS5/WAL growth — see #507 (dense
recall brute-force scan, the read-side sibling) and the scale-gate budgets
that lock today's numbers in.
